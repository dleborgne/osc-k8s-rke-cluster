# How to test your cluster

## Smoke tests

Smoke testing our newly created Kubernetes cluster can be done very similarely to [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/13-smoke-test.md).

Note that workers has no public IP so you can test Nodeport service from bastion.
