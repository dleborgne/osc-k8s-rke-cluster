# Prerequisite

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (>= 0.14)
- [RKE](https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/installation/) (>= v1.3.2)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) (>= 2.4)
- [Outscale Access Key and Secret Key](https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/Creating+an+Access+Key)

# Configuration

```
export TF_VAR_access_key_id="myaccesskey"
export TF_VAR_secret_key_id="mysecretkey"
export TF_VAR_region="eu-west-2"
```


By editing ['terraform.tfvars'](terraform.tfvars), you can adjust the number of worker/control-plane nodes, size of node and more.

# Deploy

First deploy infrastructure resources:
```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Then you should be able to deploy RKE using:
```
rke up --config rke/cluster.yml
```

You can now copy your kubeconfig file to bastion host:
```
scp -F ssh_config rke/kube_config_cluster.yml bastion:.kube/config
```

Then to complete the cluster initialization, install the CSI driver
```
ANSIBLE_CONFIG=ansible.cfg ansible-playbook osc-csi/playbook.yaml
```

Connect to bastion and test kubeapi-server:
```
ssh -F ssh_config bastion
kubectl get nodes
```

For further testing, check [testing section](testing.md).

If needed, you can connect to any worker or control-plane node:
```
ssh -F ssh_config worker-0
ssh -F ssh_config control-plane-0
```

> **_NOTE:_**  A loadbalancer is created to access the cluster from the outside, you have to modify the IP of the server by the LB DNS name in the `rke/kube_config_cluster.yml`


# Cleaning Up
First destroy your cluster using RKE:
```
rke remove --config rke/cluster.yml
```

And then destroy the infrastructure: 
```
terraform destroy
```

Alternatively, you can manually cleanup your resources if something goes wrong:
- Connect to [cockpit interface](https://cockpit.outscale.com/)
- Go to VPC->VPCs, Select the created VPC, click the "Teardown" button and validate.
- Go to Network/Security->Keypairs and delete Keypairs created for each node
- Go to Network/Security->External Ips and delete EIP created for each control-planes
- Go to Compute->Outscale Machine Image and delete created image
